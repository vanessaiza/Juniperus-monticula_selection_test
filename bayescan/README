Bayescan test aims at identifying candidate loci under natural selection from genetic data, using differences in allele frequencies between populations

The folder "Bayescan_data" contains:
	1. The file "batch_1.plink_wp.ped" which contains the data of 11 populations of Juniperus monticola downloaded from the article: 
	"Long‐term in situ persistence of biodiversity in tropical sky islands revealed by landscape genomics"
	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14461
	I exclude the populations Nevado de Colima and Tancítaro as the article suggest.

	2. The file "data_wp" which is the result of convert the file batch_1.plink_wp.ped to bayescan format, using the program PGDspider. 

	3. The files "data_wp.sel", "data_wp_AccRte", "data_wp_fst", "data_wp_Verif" are the output of running the program 
	Bayescan v2.1 using the following parameter values: prior odds for the neutral
	model was set to 100, 5000 of outputted iterations, thinning interval size of 10, 20 pilot runs,
	pilot runs of 5000 iterations, burn-in length of 50,000 iterations.
	The command line was the follow: ./bayescan data_wp -pr_odds 100 -n 5000 -thin 10 -nbp 20 -pilot 5000 -burn 50000

The folder "bin" contains:
	1. The srcript "Bayescan_test.r" to plot figures from the outputs files of Bayescan software
	2. The script with the function "plot_R.r"

The folder "plots" contains the plots results of running the script "Bayescan_test.R"

Once you have run the Bayescan analysis you must run the script "Bayescan_test.R" contained in the folder "bin" to obtain the results.
